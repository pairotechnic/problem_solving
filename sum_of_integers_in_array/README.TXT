Problem Statement : 

We have been tasked with finding the sum of all the iteger elements in an array
The elements in this array can either be integers, strings, or even lists such as this,
made of integers, strings, and lists

Here is an example : [1,2,3,[[20],5],'foo',4]



Approach : 

I have solved this recursively.
Here is the algorithm :  

1. I define a variable sum = 0
2. I traverse through each element in the list. 
    2.1. If the element is an integer, I add it to the sum
    2.2. If the element is a list, I go to step 2.
3. Finally, I print the sum 





I have solved this problem in 2 ways : 

1. Class based approach
2. Function based approach
